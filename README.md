### Business Case

Develop four models which predict dealerships expected sales and service RO's based on digital lead traffic data. The predicted output of these models are compared against the actuals for both sales and service to determine the index scores which effectively rate the dealers performance monthly. The scores are broken out into the four categories below:

```
Generating Sales
Managing Sales
Generating Service
Managing Service
```
The below implementation is a recreation of a process done in AWS and only shows the results of mock degerated data for Generating Sales. The process was the same for all four created models. 

## Architecture

The following diagram shows the general architecture used to create the models
